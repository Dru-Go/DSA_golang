/**
One advantage of the composite pattern is that it allows you to work with complex tree structures in a uniform way, without having to worry about the differences between individual objects and compositions of objects. This can make it easier to add new types of objects to the hierarchy, as they will automatically have the same interface as the existing objects.
*/

// Here is an example of the composite pattern in Go:

package main

import "fmt"

type Component interface {
	Operation() string
}

type Leaf struct {
	name string
}

func (l *Leaf) Operation() string {
	return l.name
}

type Composite struct {
	name     string
	children []Component
}

func (c *Composite) Operation() string {
	result := c.name
	for _, child := range c.children {
		result += " " + child.Operation()
	}
	return result
}

func main() {
	leaf1 := &Leaf{"Leaf 1"}
	leaf2 := &Leaf{"Leaf 2"}
	composite := &Composite{"Composite", []Component{leaf1, leaf2}}
	fmt.Println(composite.Operation()) // Output: "Composite Leaf 1 Leaf 2"
}

/**
In this example, the Component interface defines a single method called Operation. The Leaf and Composite types both implement this interface, with the Leaf type representing a simple object and the Composite type representing a composite object that can contain other Components. The Composite type has a slice of Components called children, which it uses to store the objects it contains. When the Operation method is called on a Composite object, it calls the Operation method on each of its children and combines the results into a single string.
